Add Due-date to Todo: Users can set due-dates for tasks to track deadlines. 
Priority: Tasks can be assigned a priority level (low, medium, high). 
Filters:
Due Date: Users can filter tasks based on a specific due date range.
Category: Users can filter tasks based on categories.
Priority: Users can filter tasks based on priority levels.
Subtasks: Users can create subtasks under main tasks for better task management. 
Tags: Users can add tags to tasks for easy identification and grouping. 
Sorting: Users can sort the tasks based on due date, priority, etc.
View Backlogs: Users can view tasks that are pending or missed.
