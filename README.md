Some key points:
    a. I was unable to complete auto complete due date and drag and drop tasks. There were some ideas that I had in my mind but wasn't able to implement it fully. Let me list down the logic below.
        1. For drag and drop, I referred to HTML drag and drop API for the same but I couldn't implement the same.
        2. For auto complete due date, I thought that creating a regex expression for the day, month and year and also for words like "by", "after" can work. But the implementation was getting complex and there were lot of edge cases.
